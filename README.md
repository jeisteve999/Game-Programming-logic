Number Guessing Game 
This is a simple and interactive number guessing game built with JavaScript. The program randomly selects a secret number between 1 and a maximum value, and the player must guess it. After each guess, the game gives hints whether the secret number is higher or lower, until the player gets it right.

This project is perfect for practicing fundamental JavaScript concepts such as:

Conditionals for game logic

Loops for validating and repeating processes

Array handling to track guessed numbers

Input validation to ensure correct user entries

Fun, educational, and beginner-friendly â€” a great way to improve logical thinking and programming skills!
